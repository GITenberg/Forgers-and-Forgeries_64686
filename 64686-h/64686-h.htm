<br />A forgery of a Greek bronze statuette (<a href="#fig12"><span class="smaller">BACK COVER</span></a>), and

<p class="tb"><span class="xxlarge">T</span>he usual idea of a forgery is of something deliberately fabricated to
appear to be what it is not; something conceived in sin, and carrying
the taint of illegitimacy throughout its existence. In fact, however,
many things made for quite innocent and even laudable purposes have been
used to deceive and to defraud, by means of misrepresentation or subsequent
manipulation. So the essential element in forgery lies in the way an object is
presented, rather than in the purpose that inspired its making.</p>
<p>Still, it is objects made to deceive which have always held the center of the
stage. Without doubt, the main motive for their manufacture is to make
money. But often there is an element of drama, even of romance, in the way
they come into existence. A famous example is a <i>Sleeping Cupid</i> which the
young Michelangelo is supposed have carved in imitation of the work of classical
antiquity and which, after being buried in the ground, was bought by a
dealer and sold as an antique, being rated as such until its true origin was revealed.
Though the element of deceit was present from the beginning, the
primary purpose of the work was a challenge to the past; and it is significant
that Michelangelo&rsquo;s early biographers counted the success of the imposition to
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
his credit, since it proved that he could successfully rival the sculptors of Greece
and Rome.</p>
<p>Such challenges to the past have undoubtedly inspired men who were or
ultimately became professional forgers. This seems to have been the case with
Giovanni Bastianini (1830-1868), the Italian sculptor. His admiration for
early Renaissance Italian sculpture bred in him a spirit of rivalry which issued
in the production of remarkable imitations to be exploited as originals
through collaboration with a dealer. Alceo Dossena (1878-1937) also seems to
have wanted to prove himself the equal of earlier sculptors, though later he
knowingly embarked on the making of forgeries of medieval and Renaissance
Italian sculpture, skillful enough to be purchased as originals by various museums.
The case for conscious rivalry with the past is clearer with Rouchomovski,
the nineteenth-century goldsmith, whose abilities, though sufficient
to give him a reputation in his own right, led him to make the famous tiara
of Saitaphernes, which was purchased by the Louvre as Greco-Scythian work
of the third century <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>With other forgers, however, desire to confound connoisseurs and the learned
world has been uppermost, generally bred by neglect or adverse criticism. So
it seems to have been with Thomas Chatterton and his eighteenth-century
imitations of medieval poems; perhaps it operated in the case of T. J. Wise
and his forgeries of nineteenth-century pamphlets; and apparently I. F. Ioni,
the Sienese painter and restorer, well-known for his forgeries of Italian primitive
paintings, derived at least as much satisfaction from trying to take in eminent
authorities as from the money he made. Certainly such motives inspired
H. A. Van Meegeren, the most famous forger of our time. Van Meegeren, a
dexterous painter, skillful in imitating others, did not receive the recognition
to which he felt his gifts entitled him, and turned his talents to forging the
great Dutch masters of the seventeenth century. In 1937 he achieved spectacular
success with his sale to the Rotterdam museum for $200,000 of his
<i>Disciples at Emmaus</i>, as an early work by Jan Vermeer. A vivid light is thrown
on his motives by a remark he made in 1947 after his arrest and trial: &ldquo;The
<i>Disciples</i> represented the master-stroke in my plan for vengeance.&rdquo; Later, the
desire to fill his pockets seems to have become paramount. A similar case may
be that of the Piltdown skull, once thought to be the earliest surviving relic of
prehistoric man. Recent intensive examination has proved that though the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
cranium is of respectable antiquity, the lower jaw is that of a chimpanzee
doctored to appear ancient; and there is some reason to think that it was made
and planted near where the cranium was found, by a disgruntled museum technician
who wished to prove that he could fool the learned world.</p>

</div>
<p>But whatever mixture of motives may go into making a forgery, the predominant
one is almost always financial gain. It follows that what the forger makes
is mainly determined by the market for his goods, which in turn depends on
current activity among collectors and in the learned world. In the Middle Ages,
fantastic curiosities and saintly relics were much in demand, and forgers saw
to it that the supply was kept up. Later, the growth of scientific knowledge and
religious skepticism spoiled this market; while recognition of the artist as an individual
and the development of art collections stimulated production of forgeries
imitating the work of particular artists or of particular epochs. These
have since been the staple of the forger&rsquo;s trade, reflecting the tastes of the day.
The eighteenth-century collectors&rsquo; passion for classical antiquity helped to sustain
in Rome a flourishing industry for the supply of classical statues and gems,
with Thomas Jenkins, painter, art agent, and banker as one of its leading figures;
English Regency taste produced a fine crop of imitations of S&egrave;vres and
Meissen porcelain, made both in England and elsewhere; the Gothic revival,
bringing in its train a new enthusiasm for Italian primitives, created hitherto
neglected opportunities for the forger, who maintained an active sideline in
keeping up the supply of Palissy ware and Italian majolica, until the taste of the
aesthetic period turned his attention to Delft ware; and in our own time we
have seen the forger swing from fabricating Famille Rose and Famille Verte
to meeting twentieth-century demands for the art of the T&rsquo;ang, Sung, and earlier
Chinese dynasties.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Just as he responds to changes in taste or in learned activity, so the forger follows
in the footsteps of the tourist, for whom he has provided flint implements
to be discovered in prehistoric sites; Greek and Roman coins, gems, and statuettes
at appropriate places in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor; scarabs and small
sculpture in Egypt; and today, pottery and figurines in Central and South
America.</p>
<p>Nor does the forger confine his attentions to the art of the past, but extends
them to contemporary work. Constable and Corot were imitated while they
were still living; forgeries of Renoir, Degas, Picasso, Matisse, and others are
common today; while, among Americans, Winslow Homer and Ryder fabrications
circulate freely. Artists are apt to be forgetful as to what they have produced,
especially in the case of sketches, and have been known to deny authorship
of perfectly genuine work; so that risks of confrontation are not too great.
With a contemporary artist recently dead, his work not yet fully known or catalogued,
a vogue for collecting him fanned by a skillful entrepreneur, prices not
so high as to provoke critical examination, and with not too many genuine examples
accessible for comparison, the forger is in velvet.</p>
<p>The two main methods of making forgeries, manufacture and misrepresentation,
are in practice often combined; but it is convenient to discuss them separately.
The simplest type of manufactured forgery is the straight copy, although
this has considerable disadvantages. In addition to the necessity of choosing the
right materials, imitating the right technique, and giving a proper appearance
of age, the risks of confrontation with the original are great in these days of systematic
combing of collections, aided by swift and easy travel, by photography
and widespread publication. Sometimes, the forger attempts to meet this risk of
confrontation by introducing variations into a design, so that the forgery may
pass as a version of the original. But even so, comparison of the two is almost
inevitable, with the almost equally inevitable exposure of any defects in the
copy. It is this risk that makes forgers prefer to copy objects that are types rather
than those stamped with the individuality of some particular master. The
strictly controlled design and iconography of much Byzantine painting, and its
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
standardized technique, encourages modern repetition; and the putting of one
more copy on the market is not in itself likely to arouse suspicion. Similarly, the
fact that eighteenth-century Chinese potters paid homage to those of earlier
dynasties by making most admirable copies of their work, confuses the situation
in favor of the forger. Another advantage (to the forger) of such objects is that
many of them can be reproduced by casting. With some knowledge of the materials
used for the originals and some skill in giving an appearance of age, such
things as Chinese grave figures, Greek or Near Eastern bronzes, and coins can
be produced in quantity. Sometimes, indeed, variation in the material of the
cast is an aid to deception; as in the case of Renaissance bas-reliefs, when a cast
in wax or stucco may, after some manipulation, be passed off as a sketch for a
marble original.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04c.jpg" alt="(genuine example)" width="621" height="700" />
</div>
<p>More common than straight copies of particular objects, however, are imitations
of the style of some period or master. This avoids the risk of comparison
with a more or less identical original, and helps in passing off the forgery as an
unknown example of the style it imitates. It was on this basis that Bastianini,
Rouchomovski, and Dossena worked, as did the German painter Roerich in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
imitations of Cranach and other early German masters. Usually such imitations
of a style do not embody a new conception or an original idea; for the most part
they consist of borrowings from original works, pieced together to make a more
or less consistent whole. Often, these borrowings are secondhand, being taken
from photographs, engravings, or reproductions in books. A specific case was
the use of Weisser&rsquo;s <i>Bilderatlas zur Weltgeschichte</i> (1882) by Rouchomovski for the
reliefs on the tiara of Saitapharnes. The use of such models is, however, the
Achilles&rsquo; heel of the forger. Once their source is tracked down, detection of the
imposture is almost certain.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap">An X-ray revealed modern nails in the interior.</p>
</div>
<p>That, perhaps, is why forgers have on occasion virtually abandoned the use
of models, either wholly or in part, and produced objects different from anything
that is known, but which could fit into some particular historical or cultural
background. Here, they are exploiting not only ignorant enthusiasm but
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the desire among the learned to extend knowledge of little-known epochs of
human history, or to find material that will justify theories about them. Comparatively
crude examples are the so-called Baphomets, stone figures said to
have been worshipped by the Knights Templar; and the &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; pilgrim&rsquo;s
badges made in nineteenth-century London by William Smith and Charles
Eaton, now widely known as &ldquo;Billies and Charlies.&rdquo; The appeal of the unknown
was more skillfully utilized by Rouchomovski and Van Meegeren. In the tiara
of Saitapharnes, existing models had been used, through reproductions, for the
reliefs and inscriptions; but as a whole, the tiara was something of a kind unknown,
yet eagerly sought for, and so was more readily accepted when it came
into the market. Similarly, unknown early works of Vermeer had long been a
matter of speculation among art historians, and in certain quarters a hypothetical
character for them had been built up; so that when <i>The Disciples at Emmaus</i>
appeared and more or less fitted the bill, it was all the more easy to believe in it.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>So far, the forgeries discussed have been substantially new constructions. This
is to be expected when the motives of challenge to the past or self-vindication
are at work; usually, however, the forger prefers to use a genuine piece, wholly
or in part, as a starting point for his operations. This has none of the disadvantages
of a copy; it avoids some of the difficulties of finding suitable materials;
and it provides a pattern for such things as color, texture, and surface condition,
in any changes or additions that the forger may make.</p>
<p>One possibility is to construct a forgery with the aid of genuine fragments, or
on the basis of a damaged original. Joseph Nollekens, the eighteenth-century
English sculptor, who worked with Thomas Jenkins in Rome, himself tells of
making extensive additions to pieces of Roman sculpture found as the result of
excavation, which in due course went into famous collections in England. Similarly,
Dossena sometimes used fragments of genuine <i>quattrocento</i> work in his
forgeries. This, too, was the method favored by Ioni for making his early Italian
paintings. One great convenience of such procedures (for the forger) is that if
suspicion is aroused and investigation made, it can always be alleged that the
added work is merely honest restoration. Indeed, the line between restoration
and forgery sometimes becomes blurred. Occasionally there appears in the art
market a graft of a piece of one original onto another; its sellers would be consumed
with indignation were it suggested that they had handled a forgery.</p>
<p>The exploitation of genuine work, however, often takes much simpler forms
than that described above. The signature of a master may be added to a school
piece, or to anything that bears some superficial resemblances to his work;
sometimes, indeed, the addition is to a work by the master himself, to convince
the doubting and to increase its sale value. Not infrequently, however, there is
present an inconvenient signature of the real author, which has to be obliterated
or manipulated into something more attractive. A special form of manipulation
is to put on some anonymous portrait a name which more or less fits the dress
and character of the sitter, and so increases its sale value. Shakespeare and Milton
are often so honored; and many mediocre portraits picked up in England
have been adorned with the names of Colonial worthies, and thus found a ready
market in the United States.</p>
<p>All the examples of forgery so far mentioned are of the manufactured type,
however little work may have been expended on them. In this they differ entirely
from the forgeries which depend wholly on misrepresentation, a genuine
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
article of one kind being passed off as of another, without any physical change.
It is not usual to brand such things as forgeries, and legally they are not so regarded;
but morally, in that something is made to appear what it is not, they
seem to be truly forgeries.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="(genuine example)" width="437" height="695" />
</div>
<p>A simple and widespread means of falsifying in this way is a certificate of
authorship and genuineness. Sometimes, the writers of these are of the highest
competence and probity. These two qualities are not always combined, however;
and the certificate then becomes either intentionally or innocently misleading.
Unfortunately, most certificates are written for a fee, and there is
always temptation for the writer to err on the side of pleasing his employer;
while there is no question that sometimes certificates have been given deliberately
to defraud. Moreover, forged certificates bearing reputable names are not
unknown, a special variety being the stringing together of words from a genuine
letter, with all qualifying or negative phrases omitted. There is, however, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
more insidious method of giving a certificate, that of publication of an object
in a reliable journal. Editors are generally careful enough; but they are
defenseless in the face of a plausible case put forward by a name of some reputation,
especially when the passage relating to the object is included in a
more general context. This kind of certification is particularly difficult to cope
with, since such articles will continue to be cited in later publications, perhaps
mainly to controvert them but nevertheless renewing their availability for dishonest
purposes.</p>
<p>Construction of false pedigrees is another means of misrepresentation, much
used in the case of copies or versions. Sometimes, a pedigree is completely false,
naming imaginary former owners whose existence cannot be proved but equally
cannot be disproved. Sometimes, such history as the object may have is grafted
onto that of another and accepted version, so that the two may become confused.
A special case of this is the planting out of objects in houses whose owners
are ready, for a consideration, to describe them as having descended in the family,
or even as having been bought from the maker by an ancestor.</p>
<p>The skill, ingenuity, and knowledge of the forger and of those who exploit his
work, are opposed to the skill, ingenuity, and knowledge of the collector and the
learned world. The unaided human eye, if it has a trained and well-informed
mind behind it, can go a long way in detecting forgeries. It is surprising how forgetful,
careless, or ignorant a forger can be. He may employ materials whose
inconsistency with the period to which his work claims to belong can be seen
even by the unaided eye. More common is the introduction of such things as
types and details of costume, or the use of coats of arms, that are later than the
alleged date of the work. All such evidence, however, needs scrutiny, since it
may simply be a case of later additions to a genuine object. More useful, therefore,
may be tracking down the source of a forger&rsquo;s borrowings. If, for example,
these at first sight seem to come from an original work, but follow much more
closely the variations from that original in a later copy or engraving, the conclusion
is obvious. Again, investigation of pedigrees, checking of literary references,
searching through exhibition records, may all reveal suspicious or occasionally
damning evidence of falsified history.</p>

<p>To tests based on observation and historical verification, we must add those
mainly dependent on feeling. For the sensitive and trained observer, a number
of indefinable characteristics will &ldquo;add up&rdquo; to a definite conviction of genuine
or false. Qualities of surface and handling, subtleties in color and in the definition
of form, the degree of unity in conception and treatment, and the emotional
character of the work are among the things which influence such decisions.
Thus, a copy, however exact, may reveal itself as lacking the coherence and the
feeling which inspired the original; and the most skillful imitation of some older
work may be recognized as a creation of its own time. Nobody can completely
divorce himself from the prevailing thoughts, opinions, assumptions, feelings,
and standards of his own period; and inevitably these will color whatever he
produces, whether he be a forger or an original artist.</p>
<p>Scorn is often poured on judgments of the type described, and the expert who
produces them in a court of law is the delight of the skillful cross-examiner.
True, the only merit of snap opinions based on defective sensibility and inadequate
experience is that they have a fifty-fifty chance of being right; but with
sensibility backed by knowledge, an almost supra-rational instinct develops as
to what is genuine or false. The so-called impression or hunch is, in such circumstances,
more accurately described as a synthesis of many experiences. It is often
forgotten that such almost instinctive judgments are not confined to art and
archaeology. They play an important part in the sciences (where they are called
hypotheses), in politics, in war, in business, and many other fields. Their value
varies with the men who make them; but this does not lessen their potential
value, and their occasional indispensability. In the detection of two particular
types of forgery they are especially useful. Imitations of contemporary work can
be very baffling, since the forger works with materials which were or might have
been used in genuine work, does not have to give an appearance of age, and
works against the same general background as does the artist he imitates. Similarly,
a school piece which is misrepresented as the work of an old master, was
produced in a similar physical and emotional environment. In such cases, a
final verdict often has to be based on nothing but imponderable elements of
style, realizable only through feeling based on knowledge.</p>

<p>The methods so far described of detecting forgeries may well be as old as the
practice of forgery itself. Certainly, they form the basis of all investigations of
which we have records, as well as of those made today. Their efficiency, however,
has been immensely increased by the development of scientific methods of
investigation. The first great step forward came with the use of photography,
which permitted comparison of suspicious objects with genuine examples in a
way hitherto impossible. Next came the application of various scientific techniques
to the analysis of the physical constitution of an object. So spectacular
have been the results in some cases as to create a blind faith in such methods of
investigation, almost as though a piece of scientific apparatus were an oracle
which when consulted would answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the question of whether
an object is genuine. The limits of scientific investigation are, however, clearly
marked. This method is solely concerned with the physical make-up of an object,
and is completely indifferent as to who made it, when and where it was
made, and why it was made. All that it does is to make possible the discovery of
physical facts bearing upon these matters, which have to be observed and interpreted
by human minds and used as the basis for human judgments.</p>

</div>
<p>The scientific procedures with which we are concerned here fall into two
main groups. Of these, one includes various techniques for extending the range
of human vision. The simplest is examination by microscope, which enables
characteristics of a surface to be seen that would otherwise be invisible, so that,
for example, painted cracks or cracks artificially induced can be distinguished
from crackle due to age. With the microscope, too, evidence of removals and
additions can be obtained, such as the manipulation of signatures and inscriptions,
or the presence of repaint or artificial patina; while the structure of pigments,
stone, etc., can be ascertained, as a step toward their identification. More
elaborate is examination under various rays of the spectrum, to which the human
eye is not sensitive but whose results can be recorded. The best known of
these is X-ray, which penetrates certain substances but is held up in different
degrees by others, especially metals, so that a photographic film behind an
object will record a map of such substances in an object, thus revealing much
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
that is below the surface. On the other hand, ultra-violet rays falling on a surface
cause fluorescence, which varies according to substance and texture, so that
additions to the surface may be revealed. Infra-red rays, in contrast, penetrate
the surface, and are reflected back from the layers beneath, so that a photograph
taken by infra-red light may reveal something concealed from the eye,
which X-ray may not pick up.</p>
<p>The second group of investigatory methods includes various means of analyzing
the materials present in an object. The most familiar is chemical analysis;
but this is being supplemented and to some extent displaced by spectrographic
analysis, with its recent extension in the use of X-ray diffraction. By
these means, it is possible to detect even minute traces of substances whose presence
or absence may be decisive in settling the date or provenance of a material.
Some recent applications of quantitative analysis have proved helpful in ascertaining
the date of objects. One of these techniques, determination of the extent
of fluorination, was used to prove that the jawbone of the Piltdown skull was a
modern forgery; while another, based on the amount of radio-active carbon
present, which is known to decay at a certain rate, is still in course of development,
but promises to be most useful.</p>
<p>Thus, a formidable group of weapons are available against the forger. To be
effective, however, the significance of the facts they bring to light must be understood.
Decisive proof that an object is not of the period or by the hand to which
it is attributed comes only through the discovery of facts which are not only
inconsistent with the attribution but cannot be explained except by assuming
that the attribution is wrong. For instance, the body of a work may contain a
substance unknown at its ostensible date. Modern nails inside a piece of wood
sculpture said to be of the fourteenth century; cobalt, unknown as a pigment
until the early nineteenth century, in a painting attributed to Vel&aacute;zquez; and
titanium white, a twentieth-century invention, in a portrait labelled fifteenth-century
Florentine&mdash;these are all good evidence that the object is not what it is
held out to be.</p>
<p>Moreover, the facts discovered always have to be controlled by reference to
established standards. Structure revealed by microscopic examination must be
compared with that of known substances; chemical and spectrographic analysis
has to be checked by reference to a codified series of earlier tests; crackle on a
surface can only be labelled as false if the nature of genuine crackle is known;
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and the reading of whatever is discovered by X-ray, ultra-violet, or infra-red
rays calls for comparison with verified results of previous examinations. The
facts yielded by one method of investigation may by themselves not be sufficient
evidence of forgery; if, however, they can be joined with the results of other
methods, all pointing in the same direction, a strong case can be built up. As
in a court of law, this, rather than production of a single dramatic and decisive
piece of evidence, is what usually happens.</p>
<p>It might be thought that the combination of expert and scientist would leave
the forger with his occupation gone. On the contrary, he continues to flourish.
In the face of the expert, he discards the clumsy copy and the inept certificate,
utilizing the improved methods of photography and reproduction and the increasing
flood of learned works, to help save him from anachronisms and inherent
contradictions in his work. The scientist he meets either by concentrating in
fields where scientific methods of inquiry are relatively helpless, or by himself
going to school with the scientist. The results of recent scientific work have put
at his disposal much knowledge of what to do, what to avoid, and how to baffle
certain types of investigation. Moreover, he has even taken over certain procedures
worked out by scientists, such as those for hastening the effect of time,
and has applied them to his own problems; cases are known of forgeries having
been submitted, through innocent hands, for scientific investigation, to find out
whether they will survive the ordeal, and if not, what are the mistakes to be
avoided in the future.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>One question is often asked in connection with forgeries: Why should a once-admired
object be disregarded or condemned on being proved a forgery, seeing
that it is still the same object? One reason is human snobbery; another, and
more important, is that when an object is proved to be a forgery, it is to us no
longer the same object that it was. After the discovery, human knowledge about
the positive and negative qualities of the object has increased, and a new judgment
has to be made upon it. Exactly the same thing happens with a genuine
work. As familiarity with it grows, it becomes another thing to the spectator&rsquo;s
eyes and mind, and so it may rise or fall in his esteem. Conceivably, the characteristics
which proclaim something to be a forgery might, when discovered,
cause it to be more highly regarded; but that kind of forgery is not yet known,
though it may perhaps exist.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
